# Wing-IDE-5 to 10-keygen
Keygen for activation Wing IDE from 5 to 10 

Did some modification on the coding as it is used deprecated sha library and python 2.

Changed to use hashlib and syntax able to run in python 3

Despite of this, running method is the same.


# Use
```
$python keygen.py
```
#### Add ID
#### Copy Code Request of wing IDE 
#### Paste on code for activation on wing IDE

Found the license id generated could be invalid sometimes and need to regenerate.
Need patient to rerun. 

Also, tried to test fro the Wing IDE 5 to 10 and it is wokring now.

Why I try to generate it becasue I want to test for the reverse engineering on the licnese code issue, so I can work on this simialr mechianism to some other porduct in the future.

Please reminder it is for educational purpose only, not for sale please. I shall not take any liability on this matter.
